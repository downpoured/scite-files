#summary Display SciTE interface in other languages.

= Set language =

To set the language, download a properties file, place it in the SciTE directory, and rename it locale.properties. The next time that you run SciTE, the menus will be translated. 

= Language files =


= Creating a locale file =
The menus and dialogs can be translated into another language by modifying the [http://www.scintilla.org/locale.properties locale.properties] file which should be stored in the same directory as the global properties.

If you translate SciTE, please make the translation available to others. You can either put it on your own web server and include a link on this page or add it as a file in this group.

The file names should use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes ISO 639-1 language codes].

If you contribute a translation, then I'll assume you want it to be made freely available under the same conditions as SciTE, unless there is a comment in the file stating otherwise.
