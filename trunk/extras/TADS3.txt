Editing TADS files with Scite.

To enable syntax highlighting of TADS3 files you will need to edit the
SciTEGlobal.properties file.  Select "Open Global Options File" from the Options
menu and uncomment the following line

import tads3

To add TADS3 to the language menu find the section that starts with
menu.language and uncomment the TADS3 line.

menu.language=\
...
TADS3|t||\
...


To add TADS3 file to the open file dialogue uncomment the filter.tads3 line in
the open.filter section

open.filter=\
...
$(filter.tads3)\
...

TADS source files can be added to the all source file filter.  Append ;*.t to
the source.files section

source.files=...;*.t

menu.language and source.files may also be set in the per user file
SciTEUser.properties which is available through the Options menu.

These changes take affect next time SciTE is started.

The file tads3.properties controls how TADS files appear.  The colours, font,
indentation and user defined keywords can be modified.  From the options menu
select tads3.properties.  The file has comments to guide you.  It is necessary
to restart SciTE for the changes to take effect.
